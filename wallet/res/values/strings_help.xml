			Using this dialog, you can request coins from another person (who should already have installed Quark Wallet).
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you can enter an amount of Quarks to request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, you either have the generated QR code scanned by the other person.
			Or, you can send your request to a remote person with the share button in the action bar.
			The other person will have to click the Quark URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either way, the other person will be presented a dialog for sending coins with all fields pre-populated.
			If she accepts, all she needs to do is sending the payment.

			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Quark URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the Quark address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Quark addresses or Quark requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Quarks you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a payment while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Quark Wallet.
			If you want a payment to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN).
		</p>
		<p>
			Note:
			Payments are irreversible!
			Always check the receiving address.

			<b>Important safety notes:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Quarks are stored on the device.
			<b>If you lose it, you\'ll lose your Quarks.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
			Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
			Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Quarks to another wallet</b>.
			Remaining Quarks will be lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
			If you send your Quarks into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
			Do not root your device.
			Do only install apps you fully trust.
			Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep the risk low!
			<b>Only use with small amounts</b> for day use.
		</p>
